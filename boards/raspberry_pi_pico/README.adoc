Examples of lighting effects for the {Raspberry-Pi-Pico}.

== Setup

. First, clone the repository.
+
[,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/jwillikers/smart-leds-fx.git
----

. Change to the board's directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd smart-leds-fx/boards/raspberry-pi-pico
----

. Install the {Rust} toolchain for the Raspberry Pi Pico.
+
[,sh]
----
rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
----

. Install `probe-run-rp` until support lands in upstream {probe-run}.
+
[,sh]
----
cargo install --git https://github.com/rp-rs/probe-run --branch main
----

. Install {flip-link}
+
[,sh]
----
cargo install flip-link
----

== Program

The Raspberry Pi Pico can be programmed directly through its micro USB port or using its SWD pins.

=== UF2

{elf2uf2-rs} makes it incredibly easy to flash the Raspberry Pi Pico using its micro USB port.

. Install the `elf2uf2-rs` crate.
+
[,sh]
----
cargo install elf2uf2-rs
----

. While holding the `BOOTSEL` button, attach the Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer using the micro USB port.

. Flash the board using Cargo's `run` subcommand.
+
[,sh]
----
cargo run --example rgbw-neopixel-stick-soft-blink
----

=== SWD

Opposite the micro USB port on the Raspberry Pi Pico are three pins for making an SWD connection.
Support for the Raspberry Pi Pico is missing for many popular debug probe tools currently, so using a second Raspberry Pi Pico as the debug probe works best.
Refer to <<picoprobe>> for instructions.
This section describes the general instructions to use any debug probe.

. Change the runner in `.cargo/config.toml` to `probe-run-rp`.
+
..cargo/config.toml
[source,toml]
----
[target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
runner = "probe-run-rp --chip RP2040"
----

. Now just run an example with `cargo run`.
+
[,sh]
----
cargo run --example rgbw-neopixel-stick-soft-blink
----

==== picoprobe

The `picoprobe` is a Raspberry Pi Pico configured to run as a debug probe.
To use the `picoprobe` to flash and debug the examples, follow these instructions.

. Now, boot the Raspberry Pi Pico in bootloader mode by holding the `BOOTSEL` button while plugging it in.

. Download the {UF2} file containing the `picoprobe` firmware.

. Download and install the `picoprobe` firmware: https://github.com/majbthrd/DapperMime/releases/download/20210225/raspberry_pi_pico-DapperMime.uf2.
+
[,sh]
----
wget -LP /run/media/$USER/RPI-RP2/ https://github.com/majbthrd/DapperMime/releases/download/20210225/raspberry_pi_pico-DapperMime.uf2
----

. Wire the two Picos together according to the instructions https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A60%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C115%2C841.89%2Cnull%5D[here].

== Examples

rgbw-neopixel-stick-soft-blink:: A _{soft-blink}_ effect for an {RGBW-NeoPixel-Stick} containing 8 RGBW {NeoPixel}s using the SPI MOSI pin, pin GPIO7, of the Raspberry Pi Pico.
rgbw-neopixel-strand-candy-cane:: A static pattern which alternates red and white along an {Adafruit-NeoPixel-Digital-RGBW-LED-Strip-White-PCB-30-LED} containing 150 RGBW {NeoPixel}s using the SPI MOSI pin, pin GPIO7, of the Raspberry Pi Pico.
An analog pin, GPIO 27, is connected to a {Phototransistor} which is connected to ground via a 1 kΩ resistor.
This is used to turn the LED's off when in daylight.
The lights come on for the night at dusk and during dark cloudy weather.
A moving average is used filter out noise.

== Todo

* Improve power consumption by using sleep modes and disabling unused peripherals.
